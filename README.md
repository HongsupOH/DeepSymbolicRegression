## Introduction
It aims to study the framework that leverages deep learning for symbolic regression. A recurrent neural network (RNN) calculates the probability of the best symbolic operator at a specific position. The weight parameters are optimized by risk-seeking policy formulation. This is Team project of Deep learning class (CS6353) of the University of Utah. In this project, we aim to mimic one of the best research papers in this field by recreating (deep symbolic regression)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04871].

## Implement
To implement code, you need to install `Pytorch` and it is designed based on `GPU` but you can use `CPU`. You can simply implements [main.ipynb](https://github.com/HongsupOH/DeepSymbolicRegression/blob/main/main.ipynb).
