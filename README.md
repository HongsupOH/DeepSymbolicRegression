# Deep-Symbolic-Regression
## Introduction
It aims to study the framework that leverages deep learning for symbolic regression. A recurrent neural network (RNN) calculates the probability of the best symbolic operator at a specific position. The weight parameters are optimized by risk-seeking policy formulation.
